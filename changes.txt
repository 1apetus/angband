Angband 3.1.3
=============

We, the Angband development team, are proud to present the latest iteration
of the game, in the form of Angband 3.1.3.  Like other releases in the 3.1.x
series, this is a beta, though it should be less buggy than other 3.1.x
releases have been.  Doubtless there will be another release in a few weeks
time fixing the bugs found herein, but in the meantime, play.

This release was brought to you by (in no particular order): bron, Tobias,
Eddie Grove, Antoine, Chris Carr, William Moore, Erik Osheim, Stefan O'Rear,
Peter Denison, Andi Sidwell, rhinocesaurus, and Andrew Doull, Marco and Pete
Mack.  Other people may have contributed too; if you're missed off here,
