# File: spell.txt


# This file is used to initialize the "spell" information for the Angband game.

# Do not modify this file unless you know exactly what you are doing,
# unless you wish to risk possible system crashes and broken savefiles.

# The spell indexes are defined in "x-spell.c", and must not be changed
# or savefile compatibility will be lost.

# Note that several "spell" types may share the same "textual name".
# For example, the spell "Detect Monsters" appears in both a mage
# book and a priest book; some curing spells appear in two seperate
# priest books (and might not even have the exact same effect!)

# === Understanding spell.txt ===

# N: serial number : spell name
# I: tval : sval : snum
# D: description

# 'N' indicates the beginning of an entry. The serial number must
# increase for each new spell.

# 'I' is for basic information. The tval identifies the type of
# the spell- or prayerbook. The sval identifies the book number,
# and the snum is the spell number within the book.

# 'D' is for description. As many D: lines may be used as are needed
# to describe the spell. Note that lines will need spaces at their
# ends or the beginning of the next line to prevent words from running
# together.
