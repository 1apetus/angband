Angband 3.1.0
=============

This is an Angband development version -- it may be buggy, so be warned!

Thanks go to Eytan Zweig, pelpel, and Leon Marrick for patches used in
this version.

Changes up to now:

 * Add Ey-style quickstart.  (Eytan Zweig)

 * Add DTrap indicator. (pelpel)

 * Adopted various parts of the OAngband dungeon generation code.
   (Leon Marrick) For more information, please see:
   http://dev.rephial.org/trac/attachment/ticket/156/notes.txt

 * Transient indicators now appear on the bottom line, starting at the
   left of the dungeon display; things like depth and speed appear on
   the main sidebar.  As a result of this, every timed effect is now
   displayed on the status bar.
