To build Angband using Microsoft's Visual Studio.

 1. Donload the Angband source code from http://angband.oook.cz.

 2. Make an empty win32 project in visual studio.
 3. Extract/copy the source code into the project directory. Make sure that 
    the src directory is in the project directory, rather than in another
    subdirectory.
 4. Rename src\player\util.c to src\player\p-util.c or something like that.
 5. Copy angband.ico to the src\win directory.
 6. Copy libpng.dll and zlib1.dll from src\win\dll\ to the project directory.
 7. In the project settings, in the C/C++ tab, in the additional include
    directories ilne, add: src, src/win, src/win/include.
 8. In the project settings, in the Link tab, in the Object/library modules
    line, add: "src\win\zlib1.lib src\win\libpng.lib winmm.lib " to the front
    of the line.
 9. In the project settings, also in the Link tab, remove any directory names
    (usually Debug\ or Release\) from in front of the executable name. Doing
    this will put the executeable in the project directory so you do not have
    to move it every time the project is compiled.
10. Add all of the files that end in ".c" or ".h" in the src directory EXCEPT
    those that have "main" in their name and snd-sdl.c to the project files.
    This can be done by right-clicking on the project in visual studio and 
    choosing "Add Files to Project" from the context menu or by going to
    "Project" -> "Add to Project" -> "Files" from the menu bar.
11. Add all of the files that end in ".c" or ".h" in the src\player directory
    to the project.
12. Add all of the files that end in ".c" or ".h" in the src\object directory
    to the project.
12. Add all of the files that end in ".c" or ".h" in the src\monster directory
    to the project.
13. Add all of the files that end in ".c" or ".h" in the src\win directory
    to the project.
14. Add main-win.c from the src directory to the project.

Now we need to make a couple code changes because the compiler of Visual Studio
is not a standard one.
15. Goto the File view in Visual studio. Under "Header Files", and double-click
    "z-queue.h". This will allow you edit this file. Replace the line
    "#include <stdint.h>" with:
#if defined(HAVE_STDINT_H)
#include <stdint.h>
#else /* HAVE_STDINT_H */
/* MSVC doesn't have stdint.h (which is C99), so we'll just
 * create the right pointer manually */
#ifdef_WIN64
typedef unsigned _int64 * uintptr_t;
#else /* _WIN64 */
typedef unsigned int * uintptr_t;
#endif /* _WIN64 */
#endif /* HAVE_STDINT_H */

16. Save and close z-queue.h.
17. Goto the File view in Visual studio. Under "Header Files", and double-click
    "generate.c".This will allow you edit this file. Around line 63 are two
    lines that start with "#define ROOM_". Replace these lines with the
    following block:
#if __STDC_VERSION__ >= 199901L
#define ROOM_DEBUG(...) if(0) msg(__VA_ARGS__);
#define ROOM_LOG(...) if(OPT(cheat_room)) msg(__VA_ARGS__);
#else /* __STDC_VERSION__ >= 199901L */
#define ROOM_DEBUG if(0) msg
#define ROOM_LOG if(OPT(cheat_room)) msg
#endif /* __STDC_VERSION__ >= 199901L */

18. Save and close generate.c.
19. Save the project, then compile the project. There will be a lot of
    warnings, but there should not be any errors. The warnings can be ignored.
20. If there are no errors, enjoy playing angband.

21. If there is an error saying that GetWindowLongPtr, SetWindowLongPtr, and/or
    GWLP_USERDATA is/are not defined, you are probably using an old Windows
    Platform Software Development Kit (SDK). Edit main-win.c and add the following
    section around line 89:
#ifndef GetWindowLongPtr
#define GetWindowLongPtr GetWindowLong
#endif
#ifndef SetWindowLongPtr
#define SetWindowLongPtr SetWindowLong
#endif
#ifndef GWLP_USERDATA
#define GWLP_USERDATA GWL_USERDATA
#endif

22. Save and close main-win.c.

23. Compile the project again.
24. Save the project, then compile the project. There should not be any errors
    and the executable should be built. If there are any errors, and you do not
    know how to fix them, you can ask on the forums at http://angband.oook.cz.
25. Enjoy playing Angband.


22. If there is an error saying that AC_SRC_ALPHA is not defined, you are
    probably using an old Windows Platform SDK. Edit main-win.c and add the
    following section below the additions of step 21:
#ifndef AC_SRC_ALPHA
#define AC_SRC_ALPHA 0x01
#endif
25. If there is an error saying that AlphaBlend is an unresolved external
    symbol, you need to add a library to the project. In the project settings,
    in the Link tab, in the Object/library modules line, add: "msimg32.lib "
    somewhere on the  line.
