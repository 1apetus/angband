Angband 3.0.8
- "knowledge menu" browser imported from Un/NPP.
  "~" command now shows "lore" about monsters, objects, etc.
- True menu support added; (almost) all menus now use a generic API rather
  than ad hoc event loops (aka spaghetti).  Commonly used menu layouts are scrolling
  or multi-column, (other layouts aka "skins" are easy to add). All menu actions
  (print, handle event, etc) are defined as "virtual functions" (callbacks) so you can
  write your own row-function provider, rather than depend on fitting data into a
  common data structure.  (About 1/2 the menus fit this one-off model best; the other
  half are built using a handful of common data structures, like arrays of strings.)
- Event handler added. (Menus can listen to each other, etc.)
- pref files and macro files are generated with an "API" (a simple callback wrapper.)
- Mouse support added.  Menu browsing & selection can be done with either keystrokes
  or the mouse.
- [TBD] Pathfind.
- Makefiles are cleaned up. Where appropriate, they include the list of object files
  as a common include. Makefile.std now uses primitive "modules" to add/remove support
  of various terminal interfaces. (No more uncommenting compile lines.)
- IBM/emx & Amiga/ami support removed. (If somebody would verify them, they will be
  added back, with pleasure.)
- Timed player modifiers (blind, confused, etc) now are kept in an array, not separate
  elements.  This makes it possible to iterate over them, or find them "unconditionally"
  by table access.
- "HP changes color" option for ASCII graphics imported from NPP.
- Some options set to new defaults
  (HP Changes color, flow-by-smell, flow-by-sound -- true by default)
  (run-ignore-doors, run-ignore-stairs, disturb-motion -- false by default)
- Some options eliminated
- Menu API added.
- Event API added.
- Added echo to macro trigger entry.


Bug fixes.
- OSX font selection problem fixed.


Angband 3.0.7s3
Suggestions and (more) patches welcomed.

Another, probably mildly annoying, release of Angband "3.0.7s".  This is really
almost entirely other people's work; thanks go to Hugo Kornelis, Pete Mack,
Marco K and Frank Palazzolo.  The main gameplay difference is that wands and
staves now have sensible starting charges again.

Changes:
- Browsing books now displays information about the spells therein, if
  requested.  As part of this, move spell names/descriptions/locations
  out into a new file, spell.txt.  (Hugo Kornelis)
- If a stack of rods is recharging, you'll get a message when the first 
  rod is recharged and another message when they are all recharged.
  There is no message when the second, third, etc., rod is recharged.
  (Hugo Kornelis)
- The recharge notification will now disturb you if you have set the 
  option to be disturbed when boring things happen (disturb_minor) to 
  yes.  (Hugo Kornelis)
- Add console mode patch for Windows (Frank Palazzolo).  This is 
  basically playing the game in an old-school terminal window for
  those who like uncluttered gameplay.
- Get "./configure" working properly again (Marco K).
- Modernize Mac support; now works on OS X 10.3 onwards, but the old 
  main-mac has been removed, as has the MPW makefile.  (Pete Mack)
- Added support for improved pluralization of object names.  Allow
  custom plurals for words which need them (e.g. "Kni|fe|ves" and
  "M|ous|ic|e").  Unused at present.  (Hugo Kornelis)
- Bugfix: Monsters that resist one or more of acid, lightning, fire, 
  cold, poison and water *and* resist one or more of nether, plasma, 
  nexus and disenchantment had two "it resists ..." sentences in the 
  monster info.  (Hugo Kornelis)
- Bugfix: Sustain CON was reported before Sustain DEX in self knowledge.
  Since DEX is reported before CON in all other situations, this is now
  reversed.  (Hugo Kornelis)
- Removed Lua.
- Arrow keys are now distinct from the numeric movement keys, and because
  of this you can now edit text at prompts in game properly.  Supported
  on Windows, Mac (untested), and main-gcu.c.  If you get it working for
  anything else, please tell me so I can update the patch.
- Charges for wands/staves are customisable in the lib/edit/ files.
- Autosquelch support.  (Taken originally from NPP, but heavily
  cleaned up.)
- Considerably simplify and speed up main-gcu.c.  (Thanks to Christer
  Nyfalt.)
- Various code cleanups (including removing VMS support, cleaning up
  file handling, and fixing memory leaks).
- main-x11 now reads window placement from x11-settings.prf.
- Fixed Windows bug where you can't move one of the font files after
  having played a game this reboot.  (Thanks to Leon Marrick.)
- Resizing the game window automatically updates its contents, on
  platforms which support this.
- 'next_xp' option to show experience needed for the next level,
  rather than how much you have now (fixed in s2).
- Inscribing an item with '!t' will now confirm if you try to take it
  off.
- Set wrapping width to 72 for character dumps' item information, to
  avoid well-behaved newsreaders messing them up.
- Add platform-specific ifdefs to readdib.c and main-ami.c.
- Add the recharging fix from V CVS -- things can now explode when you
  recharge them once more.
