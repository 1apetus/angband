# Body types  - currently only the standard body is used, and there
# is no facility for different bodies in p_race.txt.

# Note that each body record must take the form of a body-name line,
# followed by a sequence of alternating slot-type and slot-name lines.

# The maximum number of slots, EQUIP_MAX_SLOTS, is currently set to 20.
