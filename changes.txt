Angband 3.3.0-wip
=============

We, the Angband development team, are proud to present the latest 
iteration of the game, in the form of Angband 3.3.0-wip. Although this 
version is the conclusion of a lot of work in the 3.2.x series, Angband 
continues to evolve and many further changes are planned (and some are 
in progress). This version is not entirely bug-free but hopefully 
contains no showstoppers. Doubtless there will be another release in a 
few weeks time fixing the bugs found herein, but in the meantime, play.

This release was brought to you by (in alphabetical order of IRC 
nickname): Aerdan, Antony Sidwell, Erik Osheim, Elly, Aaron Bader, 
Lebannen, Chris Carr, William Moore, Peter Denison and Andi Sidwell. 
With special thanks to Eddie Grove for challenging us to do better and 
helping us get there. Please see the file thanks.txt for a full list of 
contributors.

This changelog is complete as of 10 Apr 2011. For later changes, see the
bug tracker at trac.rephial.org or the git logs.
